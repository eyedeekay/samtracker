# samtracker

Oh neat, that was easy.

This is an HTTP Bittorrent tracker with automatic port-forwarding to I2P, based
on [vvampirius/retracker](https://github.com/vvampirius/retracker). It is very
minimal, memory safe, and doesn't really do much other than let people announce
torrents, which is all it's supposed to do.
